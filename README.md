# My Docker Compose Files Repository

Welcome to my **selfhosted-experiments**! This is a collection of Docker Compose files I've gathered for various self-hosted projects using Docker.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the specific directory for the Docker Compose file you want to use.
2. Check the individual README in each directory for any additional instructions or requirements.
3. Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env` and fill out the required variables
4. Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.
5. Unless specified otherwise by the service README, run the following command to kickstart the service:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
